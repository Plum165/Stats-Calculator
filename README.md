# Statistics Calculator & Practice Platform  

This project is a **two-part educational web app** built for first-year university statistics practice.  

## üìä Features  

### 1. Calculator 
- Interactive calculators with **step-by-step solutions** for:
  - Basic Probability  
  - Permutations & Combinations (with/without repetition)  
  - Bayes‚Äô Theorem  
  - Conditional Probability  
  - Set Theory (union, intersection, complement, power sets, etc.)  
  - Random Variables (discrete & continuous, PMF/PDF, expectation & variance)  
  - House Advantage (bets, odds, expected value & losses)  

- Inputs guide students with **help buttons and example scenarios**.  
- Uses **MathJax** to render formulas cleanly.  
- Multiple themes, including:
  - Blood Red  
  - Spiderman (default)  
  - Red‚ÄìBlue
